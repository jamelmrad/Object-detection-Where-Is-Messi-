# Object detection: Where Is Messi ?
Object Detection Project using YOLOV7 algorithm + yolov7-e6e.pt as weights file .

This small project is made by `Jamel Edine Mrad` 12/2022 .
the question `Where is messi ?` has been a trend during the world cup , so i wanted to make use of my theoretical knowledge to build a simple Object detection model .

# NOTE!
This is not a fully working model , i built this project to make my learning journey more fun and motivating .
the project contains already a `labeled Dataset` , made with :
`https://www.makesense.ai` .
this repository also contains `label data` representation in `txt` , `xml` formats , so you can pull this repo and check the model by yourselves !
